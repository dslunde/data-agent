  - Updated QueryProcessor patterns to recognize causal queries properly
  - Added execution paths in DataAgentCore._execute_analysis()
  - Fixed misleading query classification that routed causal queries to pattern recognition

  - Integrated optimizer into both download_and_load_dataset() and load_local_dataset() workflows
  - Now applies dataset-specific optimizations automatically during data loading

### Result
All advertised advanced features (causal analysis, bottleneck detection, seasonal patterns) are now fully functional and integrated into the application execution flow.
